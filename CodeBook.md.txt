The analysis is run by run_analysis.R
This code assumes the current directory contains
# the input data files subject_test.txt,x_test.txt,y_test.txt
# the input data files subject_train.txt,x_train.txt,y_train.txt
================================================================================
The code reads in the data an calculates a tidy data set (in the data.frame) called train_testdat
The variables are 
Index; original data set index
data-set: whether the original data was the training data set of the test data set
subject: the number of the test subject
activity: The test activity; "Walking","Walking_upstairs",
              "Walking_downstairs","Sitting","Standing","Laying"
Mean: The mean of the original 516 value data vector
Sdev: : The standard deviation of the original 516 value data vector
==================================================================
The code creates a 2nd tidy data set  which it saves in the data file “acti_subject.txt”
This is a condensed data set which returns the mean and standard deviation of the data summarized for each test subject and for each activity category.
